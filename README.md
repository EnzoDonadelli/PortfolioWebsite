# PortfolioWebsite
First interactive animations to make the website prettier added.
At first working with HTML and CSS and also trying to make the Javascript script work was really challenging, but this project gave me a pretty good idea on how those 3 factors interact with each other.
This project is the start of a online portfolio that will be make by me for myself to show possible employers or people interested on my programming skills. My main goal is to show my experiences and achievements in a clean and user-friendly way through this website.
